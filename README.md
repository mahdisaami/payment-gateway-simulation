# ðŸ’³ Payment Gateway Simulation Project

This project is a **Django-based payment gateway simulator**.  
It allows you to integrate multiple packages (e.g., subscription purchase, digital products, etc.) into a single system. Each purchase flows through the `Purchase` model, then generates a `Payment`, and finally connects to a simulated payment gateway.  

The project also supports **internationalization (i18n)** for multiple languages.
